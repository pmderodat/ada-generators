   --  This package provides support for creating generators

   --  Generators are procedures that return ("yield") multiple results
   --  incrementally. This package provides a type to hold ref-counted
   --  generators and an interface to implement the actual generator
   --  procedure.

   type Generator is tagged private
     with Iterable => (First       => First,
                       Next        => Next,
                       Has_Element => Has_Element,
                       Element     => Element);
   --  Ref-counted generator that yields T values. Use the Create constructor
   --  before using it, or assign another initialized generator to it.
   --  All primitives expect initialized generators and will raise a
   --  Constraint_Error if provided uninitialized ones.

   Null_Generator : constant Generator;

   function Is_Null (G : Generator) return Boolean;

   type Cursor_Type is null record;
   --  Cursor type used in the generator iteration interface. Due to the nature
   --  of generators, cursors do not hold any state: only the generator does.
   --  Hence, iteration on a generator is a one-way process only.

   type Delegate is interface;
   procedure Generate (D : in out Delegate; G : Generator'Class) is abstract;
   --  User code to run as a generator. Inside a generator, the only Generator
   --  primitive that is valid to invoke is Yield. When it completes, all
   --  iterations on it will finish. If it aborts with an exception, the
   --  iteration aborts with an exception.

   type Delegate_Access is access all Delegate'Class;

   Generator_Error : exception;
   --  Exception raised by generator primitives in erroneous cases. Refer to
   --  primitives specifications to learn about these cases.

   function Create (D                  : Delegate_Access;
                    Transfer_Ownership : Boolean := True) return Generator;
   --  Create and return a new generator that will run the D delegate. If
   --  Transfer_Ownership is true, the ownership of D is transfered to the
   --  generator: it will be free'd when nobody refers to the coroutine
   --  anymore; otherwise it is up to the caller to make sure D is free'd while
   --  the coroutine is not running anymore. Creating a generator starts the
   --  generation (i.e. the delegate is started here).

   --  no information.

   function Next (G : Generator; C : Cursor_Type) return Cursor_Type;
   --  Assuming G is not done, resume it to make it yield its next element. As
   --  the generator may stop, one has to check whether it did yield something
   --  before retreiving it with the Element primitive.

   function Has_Element (G : Generator; C : Cursor_Type) return Boolean;
   --  Return whether the last call to Next on G yielded an element

   function Element (G : Generator; C : Cursor_Type) return T;
   --  Assuming Has_Element is true, return the element the last call to Next
   --  on G yielded.
